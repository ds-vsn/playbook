# Our Rituals
Humans are creatures of habit. Those habits define who we become. Think of these habits as good ideas. You can choose to join us in one, none, or all of them. These aren't rules. They are things we do becuase we have found value in them. If you have any habits you would like to suggest, please do not hesitate to open a PR!

## We Share Knowledge
We have a `#learnin` channel in Slack where we share good books, videos, confs etc. If we learn a cool trick in our IDE, or hear of a helpful new app, we share it as quickly as we can! We believe that a raising tide lifts all ships!

It doesn't stop there either. We share podcast, youtube, and blog recommendations. We ask how our coworkers are doing, and if there is anything we can do to help. We are a team, and we act as such.

## We Give Back
We attend the monthly Tampa Ruby usergroup/meetups. We have even been known to speak once or twice. Having a support group of peers that you can bounce thoughts, concerns, roadblocks, and solutions off of is an invaluable resource. We mentor and assist Jr Developers, as our schedule permits. We believe in the stated mission of the [Suncoast Developers Guild](https://suncoast.io/) and consider them a gem _(pun intended)_ of our community.
