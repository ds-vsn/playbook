# First Days
Your first days here will feel a bit like drinking from a firehose. That is perfectly fine. Do your best to retain what you can, but know it is ok to ask questions; lots and lots of questions!

If you come accross something that you think should be documented somewhere, ask if it is. If it is documented, note the location and come back to that reference as needed. If it isn't, feel free to document it and communicate the location!

## Working Hours

We usually start our days anywhere between 8am and 9am. We usually call it a day between 4pm and 6pm. We are not here to track your hours, or micromanage you. In other words, we believe in getting the job done. Not the number of hours you are in a particular seat. You are an adult. Be productive. Use your time wisely. Maintain a healthy work/life balance.

## Work Buddy

Usually when you start a new job in an office, it's clear who does what. It's still nice to have a work buddy to ping when you don't know where to turn. So we set up a buddy system. When you start, you'll be assigned a buddy. They'll introduce themselves, and they're totally willing to point you in the right direction when you need it. Of course, everyone is available to help, but it's nice to have a dedicated best work friend.

## Training Schedule

During the first few weeks you will do a decent amount of pair programming. You will spend hours pairing, asking questions, etc. But, you may also be asked to do various setup/entry level tasks on your own. Please don't let yourself get bogged down or stuck for even a few minutes without asking for help. We want to keep you moving forward!

Plan to spend an hour or two pairing, then an hour or two on your own, then rinse/repeat until you feel ready to take on the world!

## Equipment/Logins

Your buddy helps you with day-to-day questions you might have, but someone on our Network Services team will help you set up all the accounts you need. 

Before you start, we will order you a new laptop, any accessories you need, and an external keyboard, mouse, or monitor. Your first day will be filled with downloading software, testing credentials, etc. 

Once you are setup and ready, we will start recommending Jira stories to you from the project boards.

## HR Stuffs

Lynn (our VP of Human Resources) will work with you to get your onboarding paperwork done. She will also explain benefits, pay schedule, PTO, Sick Time, Disability (long and short term), etc. Don't be afraid to ask her questions. She is super helpful!
