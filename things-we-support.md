# Things we support
We support/believe in the the following things. These may not be our core values, but these are things we do encourage. 

## Open honest communication
We believe that open and honest communication is critial to the success of any team. If you submit a PR with issues that a coworker may want changed, please do not feel attacked over it. They are asking questions or offering suggestions to make that code better. Take pride in your work, but don't be prideful. Ask for feedback or help, then be sure to use it when it is given.

## Strong opinions, loosly held
In the same vein as open/honest communication, we also expect that everyone on the team will have their own opinions. We also expect those opinions will differ _(greatly)_ sometimes. That is OK! In fact, it is encouraged! We just expect that those opinions be loosly held. Don't let stubborness cloud your judgement. Be open to all possiblilities. Use common sense and our mission/values to do what is best for the team/Spectrio.

## Open source when possible
We believe in Open Source. We have all built our careers around open source. And in those viens, we dedicate a portion of our time to contribute to open source. You can do this a couple different ways:

  1. While using a gem, or open source tool and you see an issue, you may take time to submit an issue or PR to that gem/tools repo.
  2. If you are building a library or gem internally that does NOT contain any proprietarty code/info, you may ask the VP of Technology permission to open source that library. This very Playbook is open sourced!
